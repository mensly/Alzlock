Alzlock
=================

When installed, this application causes the Android device to
display the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. It forgets what it
is doing whenever the screen is locked and returns to the home
screen. This is useful for devices that have preinstalled 
lockscreen overrides that are stubborn about changing the 
launcher application, such as the ZGPAX S5.
